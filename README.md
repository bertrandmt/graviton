The Java version is a doodle project from, easily, 15 years ago. It's probably not fit for actual publication and probably does not reflect well on my coding abilities.

The JS version is very recent, done as a way to teach my daughter about coding and JavaScript as a language (in the spirit of Hour of Code).
